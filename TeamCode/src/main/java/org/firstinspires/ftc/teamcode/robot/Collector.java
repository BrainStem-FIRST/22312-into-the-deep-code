// state mechanics: once collector/spit state initiated, will power until time reached, them automatically turn off
// do not need to turn motor off outside of this class

// need to add color sensor; could represent the one detecting block in grabber
// the collecting sequence should end only when color sensor detects block over extended period
// collecting sequence:
// collect motor spins in, and servo slowly turns inward and rapidly resets to try and match block
// if block is good, signal for de-extension
// if block not good, spin wheels in opposite direction and run collect motor in opposite direction
// then would need to adjust robot (and potentially extension) position to search new area for block
